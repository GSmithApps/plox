"""
We want a function called ``increment_line_using_leading_whitespace``
that takes a string and a line number and does the following:

1. If the string is empty, return the empty string.
2. If the string is not empty, return the string with
   all leading whitespace removed.
3. Adds the number of returns removed to the line number
    and returns the new line number.
